. If-else: Use for simple, flexible condition checking. 
• Switch (or match): Use for multiple conditions based on a single variable 
• Loops: Use when repeating tasks, especially when iterating over 
collections or until a condition is met. 

Criteria for Choosing Control Flow: 
• Number of conditions: Simple (if-else) vs. many cases (switch). 
• Task repetition: Use loops if a task must repeat. 
• Complexity: Choose the structure that makes the code easiest to read.
